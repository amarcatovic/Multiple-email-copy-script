# Multiple-email-copy-script
Good for sending chain emails

------------------------------------------------
So I created this for a particular problem. There was a long list of people with their nemes and email adresses (about 600 of them) who applied to volunter. Instead of copying every email, I created a script that copies to clipboard emails suitable for chain email sending via gmail.

Example:

Name Surname email@mail.com
Another Person person@net.us
...

You copy the entire list and run the script

output:

email@mail.com, person@net.us

Output is copied to clipboard so that you can just open gmail(should work with other emails) and copy the output into 'To:'
